Existing approaches aim to improve diversity in training partners to approximate human behavior, but these partners are static and fail to capture adaptive behavior of humans. Exposing robots to adaptive behaviors is critical, yet when both agents learn simultaneously in a multi-agent setting, they often converge to opaque implicit coordination strategies that only work with the agents they were co-trained with. Such agents fail to generalize when paired with new partners. In order to capture the adaptive behavior of humans, we model the human-robot teaming scenario as an Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (I-POMDP), explicitly modeling human adaptation as part of the state. We propose a nested training regime to approximately learn the solution to a finite-level I-POMDP. In this framework, agents at each level are trained against adaptive agents from the level below. This ensures that the ego agent is exposed to adaptive behavior during training while avoiding the emergence of implicit coordination strategies, since the training partners are not themselves learning. We train our method in a multi-episode, required cooperation setup in the Overcooked domain, comparing it against several baseline agents designed for human-robot teaming. We evaluate the performance of our agent when paired with adaptive partners that were not seen during training. Our results demonstrate that our agent not only achieves higher task performance with these adaptive partners but also exhibits significantly greater adaptability during team interactions."}

Reducing the physical demands of this task through intelligent and personalized assistance has significant implications, particularly in industries involving repetitive low-level assembly activities. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a neural network controller for a modular Hip-Knee exoskeleton designed to assist squatting tasks. The neural network controller was trained via reinforcement learning (RL) in a physics-based, human-exoskeleton interaction simulation environment. The controller generated real-time hip and knee assistance torques based on recent joint-angle and velocity histories. Five healthy adults performed three-minute metronome-guided squats under three conditions: (1) no exoskeleton (No-Exo), (2) exoskeleton with Zero-Torque, and (3) exoskeleton with active assistance (Assistance). Physiological effort was assessed using indirect calorimetry and heart rate monitoring, alongside concurrent kinematic data collection. Results show that the RL-based controller adapts to individuals by producing torque profiles tailored to each subject's kinematics and timing. Compared with the Zero-Torque and No-Exo condition, active assistance reduced the net metabolic rate by approximately 10%, with minor reductions observed in heart rate. However, assisted trials also exhibited reduced squat depth, reflected by smaller hip and knee flexion. These preliminary findings suggest that the proposed controller can effectively lower physiological effort during repetitive squatting, motivating further improvements in both hardware design and control strategies."}

Existing speech enhancement solutions primarly rely on advanced digital signal processing techniques, deep learning methods, or complex software optimization techniques. This paper introduces a novel enhancement strategy that incorporates a physical optimization stage by dynamically modifying the geometry of a microphone array to adapt to changing acoustic conditions. A sixteen-microphone array is mounted on a robotic arm manipulator with seven degrees of freedom, with microphones divided into four groups of four, including one group positioned near the end-effector. The system reconfigures the array by adjusting the manipulator joint angles to place the end-effector microphones closer to the target speaker, thereby improving the reference signal quality. This proposed method integrates sound source localization techniques, computer vision, inverse kinematics, minimum variance distortionless response beamformer and time-frequency masking using a deep neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach outperforms other traditional recording configruations, achieving higher scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio and lower word error rate accross multiple input signal-to-noise ratio conditions."}

Enabled by probabilistic motion models, one may solve this problem by exploring the belief space of all trajectory predictions given future sensing actions to maximise information gain. However, for multi-modal motion models the notion of information gain is often ill-defined. This paper proposes a planning approach designed around maximising information regarding the target's homotopy class, or high-level motion. We introduce homotopic information gain, a measure of the expected high-level trajectory information given by a measurement. We show that homotopic information gain is a lower bound for metric or low-level information gain, and is as sparsely distributed in the environment as obstacles are. Planning sensing trajectories to maximise homotopic information results in highly accurate trajectory estimates with fewer measurements than a metric information approach, as supported by our empirical evaluation on real and simulated pedestrian data."}

Iterative learning control (ILC) improves performance by using information from previous iterations to compensate for expected errors in future iterations. This work incorporates the use of Quasi-Periodic Gaussian Processes (QPGPs) into a predictive ILC framework to model and forecast disturbances and drift across iterations. Using a recent structural equation formulation of QPGPs, the proposed approach enables efficient inference with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}(i^2p^3)$, where $p$ denotes the number of points within an iteration and $i$ represents the total number of iterations, specially for larger $i$. This formulation also enables parameter estimation without loss of information, making continual GP learning computationally feasible within the control loop. By predicting next-iteration error profiles rather than relying only on past errors, the controller achieves faster convergence and maintains this under time-varying disturbances. We benchmark the method against both standard ILC and conventional Gaussian Process (GP)-based predictive ILC on three tasks, autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking, a three-link robotic manipulator, and a real-world Stretch robot experiment. Across all cases, the proposed approach converges faster and remains robust under injected and natural disturbances while reducing computational cost. This highlights its practicality across a range of repetitive dynamical systems."}

Inspired by this capability, we study long-horizon multi-object non-prehensile rearrangement for mobile robots using a single egocentric camera. We introduce EgoPush, a policy learning framework that enables egocentric, perception-driven rearrangement without relying on explicit global state estimation that often fails in dynamic scenes. EgoPush designs an object-centric latent space to encode relative spatial relations among objects, rather than absolute poses. This design enables a privileged reinforcement-learning (RL) teacher to jointly learn latent states and mobile actions from sparse keypoints, which is then distilled into a purely visual student policy. To reduce the supervision gap between the omniscient teacher and the partially observed student, we restrict the teacher's observations to visually accessible cues. This induces active perception behaviors that are recoverable from the student's viewpoint. To address long-horizon credit assignment, we decompose rearrangement into stage-level subproblems using temporally decayed, stage-local completion rewards. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that EgoPush significantly outperforms end-to-end RL baselines in success rate, with ablation studies validating each design choice. We further demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on a mobile platform in the real world. Code and videos are available at https://ai4ce.github.io/EgoPush/."}

To fill this gap, we introduce the ScaleMaster Dataset, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate scale consistency under challenging scenarios such as multi-floor structures, long trajectories, repetitive views, and low-texture regions. We systematically analyze the vulnerability of state-of-the-art deep monocular visual SLAM systems to scale inconsistency, providing both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Crucially, our analysis extends beyond traditional trajectory metrics to include a direct map-to-map quality assessment using metrics like Chamfer distance against high-fidelity 3D ground truth. Our results reveal that while recent deep monocular visual SLAM systems demonstrate strong performance on existing benchmarks, they suffer from severe scale-related failures in realistic, large-scale indoor environments. By releasing the ScaleMaster dataset and baseline results, we aim to establish a foundation for future research toward developing scale-consistent and reliable visual SLAM systems."}

This work addresses these constraints through a volume-optimized spindle-shaped angled actuator (SSAA) geometry: by reducing actuator volume by 35.7% (357mL vs. 555mL), the SSAA maintains 94.2% of output torque while achieving 35.2% faster dynamic response compared to uniform cylindrical designs. Building on the SSAA, we develop a curved abduction actuator (CAA) based on the SSAA geometry and a horizontal adduction actuator (HAA) based on the pouch motor principle, integrating both into a dual-DOF textile-based shoulder exosuit (390 g). The exosuit delivers multi-modal assistance spanning shoulder abduction, flexion, and horizontal adduction, depending on the actuation.\n  User studies with 10 healthy participants reveal that the exosuit substantially reduces electromyographic (EMG) activity across both shoulder abduction and flexion tasks. For abduction with HAA only, the exosuit achieved up to 59% muscle activity reduction across seven muscles. For flexion, both the single-actuator configuration (HAA only) and the dual-actuator configuration (HAA,+,CAA) reduced EMG activity by up to 63.7% compared to no assistance. However, the incremental benefit of adding the CAA to existing HAA support was limited in healthy users during flexion, with statistically significant additional reductions observed only in pectoralis major. These experimental findings characterize actuator contributions in healthy users and provide design guidance for multi-DOF exosuit systems."}

Only a few previous works, often accompanied by additional sensors, utilize lines to compensate for the severe domain discrepancies of event sensors along with unpredictable noise characteristics. We propose a method that can stably extract tracks of varying appearances of lines using a clever algorithmic process that observes multiple representations from various time slices of events, compensating for potential adversaries within the event data. We then propose geometric cost functions that can refine the 3D line maps and camera poses, eliminating projective distortions and depth ambiguities. The 3D line maps are highly compact and can be equipped with our proposed cost function, which can be adapted for any observations that can detect and extract line structures or projections of them, including 3D point cloud maps or image observations. We demonstrate that our formulation is powerful enough to exhibit a significant performance boost in event-based mapping and pose refinement across diverse datasets, and can be flexibly applied to multimodal scenarios.

However, such policies often exploit unnatural high-frequency signals that are unachievable by humans or physical robots, making them poor representations of real-world behaviors. Existing work addresses this issue by adding a reward term that penalizes a large change in actions over time. This term often requires substantial tuning efforts. We propose to use the action Jacobian penalty, which penalizes changes in action with respect to the changes in simulated state directly through auto differentiation. This effectively eliminates unrealistic high-frequency control signals without task specific tuning. While effective, the action Jacobian penalty introduces significant computational overhead when used with traditional fully connected neural network architectures. To mitigate this, we introduce a new architecture called a Linear Policy Net (LPN) that significantly reduces the computational burden for calculating the action Jacobian penalty during training. In addition, a LPN requires no parameter tuning, exhibits faster learning convergence compared to baseline methods, and can be more efficiently queried during inference time compared to a fully connected neural network. We demonstrate that a Linear Policy Net, combined with the action Jacobian penalty, is able to learn policies that generate smooth signals while solving a number of motion imitation tasks with different characteristics, including dynamic motions such as a backflip and various challenging parkour skills. Finally, we apply this approach to create policies for dynamic motions on a physical quadrupedal robot equipped with an arm."}

The results show that the mechanical characteristics, including critical forces and stability, can be tuned solely by adjusting the boundary constraints. The spiral geometry allows large reversible deformation even when made from a relatively stiff material such as PLA, providing a straightforward design concept for controllable snapping behavior. The developed mechanism was further integrated into a swimming robot, where tendon-driven fins exhibited two distinct actuation modes: reciprocating and non-reciprocating motion. The latter enabled efficient propulsion, producing a forward displacement of about 32 mm per 0.4 s cycle ($\\approx$ 81 mm/s, equivalent to 0.4 body lengths per second).

The device translates torsional deformation into measurable capacitance changes, enabling proprioceptive feedback for soft robotic systems. Using dissolvable-core molding, we fabricated a monolithic silicone structure with embedded conductive TPU electrodes, forming an integrated soft capacitor. Mechanical characterization revealed low stiffness and minimal impedance, with torque values below 0.01 N mm for axial displacements between -15 mm and 15 mm, and up to 0.03 N mm at 30 degrees twist under compression. Finite-element simulations confirmed localized stresses along fold lines and validated the measured torque-rotation response. Electrical tests showed consistent capacitance modulation up to 30%, directly correlated with the twist angle, and maximal sensitivity of S_theta ~ 0.0067 pF/deg at 5 mm of axial deformation."}

El-Wakeel"], "title": "Learning to Tune Pure Pursuit in Autonomous Racing: Joint Lookahead and Steering-Gain Control with PPO", "comment": null, "summary": "Pure Pursuit (PP) is widely used in autonomous racing for real-time path tracking due to its efficiency and geometric clarity, yet performance is highly sensitive to how key parameters-lookahead distance and steering gain-are chosen. Standard velocity-based schedules adjust these only approximately and often fail to transfer across tracks and speed profiles. We propose a reinforcement-learning (RL) approach that jointly chooses the lookahead Ld and a steering gain g online using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The policy observes compact state features (speed and curvature taps) and outputs (Ld, g) at each control step. Trained in F1TENTH Gym and deployed in a ROS 2 stack, the policy drives PP directly (with light smoothing) and requires no per-map retuning. Across simulation and real-car tests, the proposed RL-PP controller that jointly selects (Ld, g) consistently outperforms fixed-lookahead PP, velocity-scheduled adaptive PP, and an RL lookahead-only variant, and it also exceeds a kinematic MPC raceline tracker under our evaluated settings in lap time, path-tracking accuracy, and steering smoothness, demonstrating that policy-guided parameter tuning can reliably improve classical geometry-based control."}

Demystifying VLA Inference Performance with VLA-Perf", "comment": null, "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across various embodied AI tasks. While deploying VLA models on real-world robots imposes strict real-time inference constraints, the inference performance landscape of VLA remains poorly understood due to the large combinatorial space of model architectures and inference systems. In this paper, we ask a fundamental research question: How should we design future VLA models and systems to support real-time inference? To address this question, we first introduce VLA-Perf, an analytical performance model that can analyze inference performance for arbitrary combinations of VLA models and inference systems. Using VLA-Perf, we conduct the first systematic study of the VLA inference performance landscape. From a model-design perspective, we examine how inference performance is affected by model scaling, model architectural choices, long-context video inputs, asynchronous inference, and dual-system model pipelines. From the deployment perspective, we analyze where VLA inference should be executed -- on-device, on edge servers, or in the cloud -- and how hardware capability and network performance jointly determine end-to-end latency. By distilling 15 key takeaways from our comprehensive evaluation, we hope this work can provide practical guidance for the design of future VLA models and inference systems."}

In this study, an eccentric dome-shaped snapping actuator is developed to generate controllable asymmetric motion through geometry-induced instability. Finite element simulations and experiments reveal consistent asymmetric deformation and the corresponding pressure characteristics. By coupling four snapping actuators in a pneumatic network, a compact quadrupedal robot achieves coordinated wavelike locomotion using only a single pressure input. The robot exhibits frequency-dependent performance with a maximum speed of 72.78~mm/s at 7.5~Hz. These findings demonstrate the potential of asymmetric snapping mechanisms for physically controlled actuation and lay the groundwork for fully untethered and efficient soft robotic systems."}
