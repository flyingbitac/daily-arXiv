In these applications, synchronized visuomotor feedback can evoke a sense of body ownership and agency, contributing to the experience of embodiment. We extend this work by employing embreathment, the representation of the user's own breath in real time, as a means for enhancing user embodiment experience in robots. In a within-subjects experiment, participants controlled a robotic arm, while its movements were either synchronized or non-synchronized with their own breath. Synchrony was shown to significantly increase body ownership, and was preferred by most participants. We propose the representation of physiological signals as a novel interoceptive pathway for human-robot interaction, and discuss implications for telepresence, prosthetics, collaboration with robots, and shared autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u547c\u5438\u540c\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u7528\u6237\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u611f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u547c\u5438\u540c\u6b65\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8eab\u4f53\u6240\u6709\u6743\u611f", "motivation": "\u5728\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5448\u73b0\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u4ee5\u5524\u8d77\u8eab\u4f53\u6240\u6709\u6743\u611f\u548c\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u547c\u5438\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u611f\u53d7\u901a\u8def\u7684\u63a2\u7d22", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u88ab\u8bd5\u5185\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8ba9\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\uff0c\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u8fd0\u52a8\u8981\u4e48\u4e0e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u81ea\u8eab\u547c\u5438\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8eab\u4f53\u6240\u6709\u6743\u611f\u7684\u5dee\u5f02", "result": "\u547c\u5438\u540c\u6b65\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8eab\u4f53\u6240\u6709\u6743\u611f\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u66f4\u559c\u6b22\u540c\u6b65\u6761\u4ef6", "conclusion": "\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u547c\u5438\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u65b0\u5185\u611f\u53d7\u901a\u8def\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5448\u73b0\u3001\u5047\u80a2\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c"}}

Embodied navigation, as a crucial component of such capabilities, leverages the compact and expressive nature of 3DSGs to enable long-horizon reasoning and planning in complex, large-scale environments. However, prior works rely on a static-world assumption, defining traversable space solely based on static spatial layouts and thereby treating interactable obstacles as non-traversable. This fundamental limitation severely undermines their effectiveness in real-world scenarios, leading to limited reachability, low efficiency, and inferior extensibility.

A common strategy for correcting accumulated error is visual loop closure in SLAM, which adjusts the pose graph when the agent revisits previously mapped locations. These techniques typically rely on identifying visual mappings between the current view and previously observed scenes and often require fusing data from multiple sensors.\n  In contrast, this work introduces NeRF-Assisted 3D-3D Pose Alignment (NAP3D), a complementary approach that leverages 3D-3D correspondences between the agent's current depth image and a pre-trained Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). By directly aligning 3D points from the observed scene with synthesized points from the NeRF, NAP3D refines the estimated pose even from novel viewpoints, without relying on revisiting previously observed locations.\n  This robust 3D-3D formulation provides advantages over conventional 2D-3D localization methods while remaining comparable in accuracy and applicability. Experiments demonstrate that NAP3D achieves camera pose correction within 5 cm on a custom dataset, robustly outperforming a 2D-3D Perspective-N-Point baseline. On TUM RGB-D, NAP3D consistently improves 3D alignment RMSE by approximately 6 cm compared to this baseline given varying noise, despite PnP achieving lower raw rotation and translation parameter error in some regimes, highlighting NAP3D's improved geometric consistency in 3D space. By providing a lightweight, dataset-agnostic tool, NAP3D complements existing SLAM and localization pipelines when traditional loop closure is unavailable.", "AI": {"tldr": "NAP3D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528NeRF\u8fdb\u884c3D-3D\u59ff\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3NeRF\u5408\u6210\u76843D\u70b9\u4e91\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u6821\u6b63\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bbf\u5148\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf2D-3D\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f66\u8f86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ed\u73af\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u8bbf\u5148\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNeRF-Assisted 3D-3D Pose Alignment (NAP3D)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3NeRF\u4e4b\u95f4\u76843D-3D\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u76843D\u70b9\u4e0eNeRF\u5408\u6210\u76843D\u70b9\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u7cbe\u70bc\u4f30\u8ba1\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bbf\u5148\u524d\u89c2\u5bdf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNAP3D\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e865\u5398\u7c73\u5185\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u4f18\u4e8e2D-3D Perspective-N-Point\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5728TUM RGB-D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNAP3D\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u55843D\u5bf9\u9f50RMSE\u7ea66\u5398\u7c73\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1PnP\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u5e73\u79fb\u53c2\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46NAP3D\u57283D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NAP3D\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5f53\u4f20\u7edf\u95ed\u73af\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u7684SLAM\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u51763D-3D\u516c\u5f0f\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf2D-3D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u3002"}}

Conventional performance metrics such as precision, recall and the F1-score assess the overall detection accuracy, but they do not consider the safety-relevant aspects of perception. Consequently, perception systems that achieve high scores in these metrics may still cause misdetections that could lead to severe accidents. Therefore, it is important to evaluate not only the overall performance of perception systems, but also their safety. We therefore introduce a novel safety metric for jointly evaluating the most critical perception tasks, object and lane detection. Our proposed framework integrates a new, lightweight object safety metric that quantifies the potential risk associated with object detection errors, as well as an lane safety metric including the interdependence between both tasks that can occur in safety evaluation. The resulting combined safety score provides a unified, interpretable measure of perception safety performance. Using the DeepAccident dataset, we demonstrate that our approach identifies safety critical perception errors that conventional performance metrics fail to capture. Our findings emphasize the importance of safety-centric evaluation methods for perception systems in autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u4f53\u548c\u8f66\u9053\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001F1\u5206\u6570\uff09\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u6574\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u8003\u8651\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u7279\u5b9a\u8bef\u68c0\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7269\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff1b2\uff09\u8f66\u9053\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u7269\u4f53\u4e0e\u8f66\u9053\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b3\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepAccident\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u4f20\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5b89\u5168\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u8861\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

While AMRs in indoor environments like factories can be supported by infrastructure, involving external sensors and computational resources, such systems remain underexplored in the literature. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of infrastructure-based AMR systems, outlining key opportunities and challenges. To support this, we introduce a reference architecture combining infrastructure-based sensing, on-premise cloud computing, and onboard autonomy.

VLA-AN addresses four major limitations of existing large aerial navigation models: the data domain gap, insufficient temporal navigation with reasoning, safety issues with generative action policies, and onboard deployment constraints. First, we construct a high-fidelity dataset utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) to effectively bridge the domain gap. Second, we introduce a progressive three-stage training framework that sequentially reinforces scene comprehension, core flight skills, and complex navigation capabilities. Third, we design a lightweight, real-time action module coupled with geometric safety correction. This module ensures fast, collision-free, and stable command generation, mitigating the safety risks inherent in stochastic generative policies. Finally, through deep optimization of the onboard deployment pipeline, VLA-AN achieves a robust real-time 8.3x improvement in inference throughput on resource-constrained UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLA-AN significantly improves spatial grounding, scene reasoning, and long-horizon navigation, achieving a maximum single-task success rate of 98.1%, and providing an efficient, practical solution for realizing full-chain closed-loop autonomy in lightweight aerial robots.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLA-AN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u673a\u8f7d\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca\u673a\u8f7d\u90e8\u7f72\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u6570\u636e\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff1b2) \u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3) \u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\uff1b4) \u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u673a\u8f7d\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u5f25\u5408\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u2192\u6838\u5fc3\u98de\u884c\u6280\u80fd\u2192\u590d\u6742\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u5b89\u5168\u6821\u6b63\u786e\u4fdd\u78b0\u649e\u81ea\u7531\uff1b4) \u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u8f7d\u90e8\u7f72\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "VLA-AN\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e868.3\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u523098.1%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u573a\u666f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5168\u94fe\u95ed\u73af\u81ea\u4e3b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "VLA-AN\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u90e8\u7f72\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5168\u94fe\u95ed\u73af\u81ea\u4e3b\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Designing human-robot systems to meet these demands requires an explicit understanding of the work functions and constraints that shape the feasibility of alternative joint work strategies. Yet existing human-robot interaction frameworks either emphasize computational support for real-time execution or rely on static representations for design, offering limited support for reasoning about coordination dynamics during early-stage conceptual design. To address this gap, this article presents a novel computational framework for analyzing joint work strategies in human-robot systems by integrating techniques from functional modeling with graph-theoretic representations. The framework characterizes collective work in terms of the relationships among system functions and the physical and informational structure of the work environment, while explicitly capturing how coordination demands evolve over time. Its use during conceptual design is demonstrated through a case study in disaster robotics, which shows how the framework can be used to support early trade-space exploration of human-robot coordination strategies and to identify cooperative competencies that support flexible management of coordination overhead. These results show how the framework makes coordination demands and their temporal evolution explicit, supporting design-time reasoning about cooperative competency requirements and work demands prior to implementation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8054\u5408\u5de5\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u6790\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u529f\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u56fe\u8bba\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6982\u5ff5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709HRI\u6846\u67b6\u8981\u4e48\u5f3a\u8c03\u5b9e\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u6982\u5ff5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u652f\u6301", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u529f\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u56fe\u8bba\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u5f81\u96c6\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u6355\u6349\u534f\u8c03\u9700\u6c42\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u707e\u96be\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e9\u671f\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u6743\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u652f\u6301\u534f\u8c03\u5f00\u9500\u7075\u6d3b\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u534f\u8c03\u9700\u6c42\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u663e\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u5b9e\u65bd\u524d\u5bf9\u5408\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u9700\u6c42\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u63a8\u7406"}}

This raises a critical need for novel methods that verify ownership and detect unauthorized, possibly unsafe misuse. While watermarking is established in other domains, physical policies present a unique challenge: remote detection. Existing methods assume access to the robot's internal state, but auditors are often limited to external observations (e.g., video footage). This ``Physical Observation Gap'' means the watermark must be detected from signals that are noisy, asynchronous, and filtered by unknown system dynamics. We formalize this challenge using the concept of a \\textit{glimpse sequence}, and introduce Colored Noise Coherency (CoNoCo), the first watermarking strategy designed for remote detection. CoNoCo embeds a spectral signal into the robot's motions by leveraging the policy's inherent stochasticity. To show it does not degrade performance, we prove CoNoCo preserves the marginal action distribution. Our experiments demonstrate strong, robust detection across various remote modalities, including motion capture and side-way/top-down video footage, in both simulated and real-world robot experiments. This work provides a necessary step toward protecting intellectual property in robotics, offering the first method for validating the provenance of physical policies non-invasively, using purely remote observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u8fdc\u7a0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5CoNoCo\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u9891\u8c31\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u89c2\u5bdf\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u5373\u53ef\u4ece\u5916\u90e8\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u6c34\u5370\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6240\u6709\u6743\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u8bbf\u95ee\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8005\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u89c2\u6d4b\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\"\u7269\u7406\u89c2\u5bdf\u5dee\u8ddd\"\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Colored Noise Coherency (CoNoCo)\u6c34\u5370\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u9891\u8c31\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\"\u4e00\u77a5\u5e8f\u5217\"\u6982\u5ff5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8fdc\u7a0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660eCoNoCo\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCoNoCo\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8fdc\u7a0b\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u90fd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u548c\u4fa7\u89c6/\u4fef\u89c6\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5747\u6709\u6548\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528\u7eaf\u8fdc\u7a0b\u89c2\u6d4b\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7269\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5fc5\u8981\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u8fdc\u7a0b\u89c2\u6d4b\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7269\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u89c2\u5bdf\u5dee\u8ddd\u8fd9\u4e00\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

To overcome this limitation, we propose MiVLA, a generalizable VLA empowered by human-robot mutual imitation pre-training, which leverages inherent behavioral similarity between human hands and robotic arms to build a foundation of strong behavioral priors for both human actions and robotic control. Specifically, our method utilizes kinematic rules with left/right hand coordinate systems for bidirectional alignment between human and robot action spaces. Given human or simulated robot demonstrations, MiVLA is trained to forecast behavior trajectories for one embodiment, and imitate behaviors for another one unseen in the demonstration. Based on this mutual imitation, it integrates the behavioral fidelity of real-world human data with the manipulative diversity of simulated robot data into a unified model, thereby enhancing the generalization capability for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on both simulation and real-world platforms with three robots (ARX, PiPer and LocoMan), demonstrate that MiVLA achieves strong improved generalization capability, outperforming state-of-the-art VLAs (e.g., $\\boldsymbol\u03c0_{0}$, $\\boldsymbol\u03c0_{0.5}$ and H-RDT) by 25% in simulation, and 14% in real-world robot control tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiVLA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u673a\u76f8\u4e92\u6a21\u4eff\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u624b\u4e0e\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5efa\u7acb\u884c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLA\uff09\u5728\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMiVLA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u673a\u76f8\u4e92\u6a21\u4eff\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5de6\u53f3\u624b\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6216\u4eff\u771f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u6a21\u4eff\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u89c1\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6574\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\uff08ARX\u3001PiPer\u548cLocoMan\uff09\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cMiVLA\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709VLA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u03c0\u2080\u3001\u03c0\u2080.\u2085\u548cH-RDT\uff0925%\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e14%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u673a\u76f8\u4e92\u6a21\u4eff\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0cMiVLA\u6210\u529f\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The effectiveness of the LBVT mechanism is evaluated through simulation-based analyses. The results confirm that the system achieves up to a 40 percent increase in transmission ratio upon reaching a predefined torque threshold, effectively amplifying joint torque when required without additional actuation. Furthermore, the simulations demonstrate a torque amplification effect triggered when the applied force exceeds 18 N, highlighting the system ability to autonomously respond to varying load conditions. This research contributes to the development of lightweight, efficient, and adaptive transmission systems for robotic applications, particularly in legged robots where dynamic torque adaptation is critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u4f20\u52a8\u6bd4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u7d27\u5f39\u7c27\u548c\u56db\u8fde\u6746\u673a\u6784\u88ab\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u4f20\u52a8\u6bd4\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6267\u884c\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u5916\u90e8\u626d\u77e9\u9700\u6c42\u52a8\u6001\u6539\u53d8\u4f20\u52a8\u6bd4\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5173\u8282\u9a71\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u53d8\u4f20\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6267\u884c\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5173\u8282\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u88ab\u52a8\u54cd\u5e94\u8d1f\u8f7d\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6267\u884c\u5668\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u4f20\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u626d\u77e9\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u4f20\u52a8\uff08LBVT\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u7d27\u5f39\u7c27\u548c\u56db\u8fde\u6746\u673a\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u88ab\u52a8\u4f20\u52a8\u6bd4\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u5f53\u5916\u90e8\u626d\u77e9\u8d85\u8fc7\u9884\u8bbe\u9608\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u6539\u53d8\u4f20\u52a8\u6bd4\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f53\u8fbe\u5230\u9884\u8bbe\u626d\u77e9\u9608\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f20\u52a8\u6bd4\u53ef\u589e\u52a0\u9ad8\u8fbe40%\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u653e\u5927\u5173\u8282\u626d\u77e9\u3002\u5f53\u65bd\u52a0\u529b\u8d85\u8fc718N\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u626d\u77e9\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u54cd\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "LBVT\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4f20\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u626d\u77e9\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u88ab\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u4f20\u52a8\u6bd4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9a71\u52a8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While open-source initiatives have democratized vehicle construction and control software, a substantial gap persists for joint-actuated systems-particularly those requiring waterproof, feedback-enabled actuation suitable for manipulators, grippers, and bioinspired devices. As a result, many research groups face lengthy development cycles, limited reproducibility, and difficulty transitioning laboratory prototypes to field-ready platforms.\n  To address this gap, we introduce an open, cost-effective hardware and software toolkit for underwater manipulation research. The toolkit includes a depth-rated Underwater Robotic Joint (URJ) with early leakage detection, compact control and power management electronics, and a ROS2-based software stack for sensing and multi-mode actuation. All CAD models, fabrication files, PCB sources, firmware, and ROS2 packages are openly released, enabling local manufacturing, modification, and community-driven improvement.\n  The toolkit has undergone extensive laboratory testing and multiple field deployments, demonstrating reliable operation up to 40 m depth across diverse applications, including a 3-DoF underwater manipulator, a tendon-driven soft gripper, and an underactuated sediment sampler. These results validate the robustness, versatility, and reusability of the toolkit for real marine environments.\n  By providing a fully open, field-tested platform, this work aims to lower the barrier to entry for underwater manipulation research, improve reproducibility, and accelerate innovation in underwater field robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u6e90\u6c34\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5173\u8282\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff1a\u5305\u542b\u9632\u6c34\u5173\u8282\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u548cROS2\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6808\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u6c34\u4e0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7814\u7a76\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u5df2\u572840\u7c73\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1", "motivation": "\u6c34\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6d77\u6d0b\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u6c34\u4e0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u53d7\u5230\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3001\u4e13\u6709\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u5df2\u4f7f\u8f66\u8f86\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u8282\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9700\u8981\u9632\u6c34\u3001\u5e26\u53cd\u9988\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff09\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7814\u7a76\u5468\u671f\u957f\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u539f\u578b\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u73b0\u573a\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6c34\u4e0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7814\u7a76\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u6df1\u5ea6\u989d\u5b9a\u6c34\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5173\u8282\uff08URJ\uff09\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u65e9\u671f\u6cc4\u6f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u529f\u80fd\uff1b2\uff09\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7535\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eROS2\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6808\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u3002\u6240\u6709CAD\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5236\u9020\u6587\u4ef6\u3001PCB\u6e90\u6587\u4ef6\u3001\u56fa\u4ef6\u548cROS2\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u90fd\u5f00\u6e90\u53d1\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u591a\u6b21\u73b0\u573a\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u572840\u7c73\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\uff1a3\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u6c34\u4e0b\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u3001\u808c\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u8f6f\u5939\u722a\u548c\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u6c89\u79ef\u7269\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6d77\u6d0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u5168\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u7ecf\u8fc7\u73b0\u573a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u6c34\u4e0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5165\u95e8\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u6c34\u4e0b\u73b0\u573a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u3002"}}
