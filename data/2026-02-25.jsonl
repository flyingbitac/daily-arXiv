It typically comprising a Vision-Language backbone for perception and understanding, together with a generative policy for action generation. However, its performance is increasingly bottlenecked by the action generation proceess. (i) Low inference efficiency. A pronounced distributional gap between isotropic noise priors and target action distributions, which increases denoising steps and the incidence of infeasible samples. (ii) Poor robustness. Existing policies condition solely on the current observation, neglecting the constraint of history sequence and thus lacking awareness of task progress and temporal consistency. To address these issues, we introduce OptimusVLA, a dual-memory VLA framework with Global Prior Memory (GPM) and Local Consistency Memory (LCM). GPM replaces Gaussian noise with task-level priors retrieved from semantically similar trajectories, thereby shortening the generative path and reducing the umber of function evaluations (NFE). LCM dynamically models executed action sequence to infer task progress and injects a learned consistency constraint that enforces temporal coherence and smoothness of trajectory. Across three simulation benchmarks, OptimusVLA consistently outperforms strong baselines: it achieves 98.6% average success rate on LIBERO, improves over pi_0 by 13.5% on CALVIN, and attains 38% average success rate on RoboTwin 2.0 Hard. In Real-World evaluation, OptimusVLA ranks best on Generalization and Long-horizon suites, surpassing pi_0 by 42.9% and 52.4%, respectively, while delivering 2.9x inference speedup."}

Unlike physicians, who can directly manipulate guidewires and integrate tactile feedback with their prior anatomical knowledge, teleoperated robotic systems must rely solely on 2D projections. This mode of operation, simultaneously lacking spatial context and tactile sensation, may give rise to projection-induced ambiguities at vascular bifurcations. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage framework (SCAR-UNet-GAT) for real-time robotic path planning. In the first stage, SCAR-UNet, a spatial-coordinate-attention-regularized U-Net, is employed for accurate coronary vessel segmentation. The integration of multi-level attention mechanisms enhances the delineation of thin, tortuous vessels and improves robustness against imaging noise. From the resulting binary masks, vessel centerlines and bifurcation points are extracted, and geometric descriptors (e.g., branch diameter, intersection angles) are fused with local DSA patches to construct node features. In the second stage, a Graph Attention Network (GAT) reasons over the vessel graph to identify anatomically consistent and clinically feasible trajectories, effectively distinguishing true bifurcations from projection-induced false crossings. On a clinical DSA dataset, SCAR-UNet achieved a Dice coefficient of 93.1%. For path disambiguation, the proposed GAT-based method attained a success rate of 95.0% and a target-arrival success rate of 90.0%, substantially outperforming conventional shortest-path planning (60.0% and 55.0%) and heuristic-based planning (75.0% and 70.0%).

Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising approach for autonomous catheter steering; however, conventional methods suffer from sparse reward design and reliance on static vascular models, limiting their sample efficiency and generalization to intraoperative variations. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a sample-efficient RL framework with online expert correction for autonomous catheter steering in endovascular bifurcation navigation. The proposed framework integrates three key components: (1) A segmentation-based pose estimation module for accurate real-time state feedback, (2) A fuzzy controller for bifurcation-aware orientation adjustment, and (3) A structured reward generator incorporating expert priors to guide policy learning. By leveraging online expert correction, the framework reduces exploration inefficiency and enhances policy robustness in complex vascular structures. Experimental validation on a robotic platform using a transparent vascular phantom demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves convergence in 123 training episodes -- a 25.9% reduction compared to the baseline Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm -- while reducing average positional error to 83.8% of the baseline. These results indicate that combining sample-efficient RL with online expert correction enables reliable and accurate catheter steering, particularly in anatomically challenging bifurcation scenarios critical for endovascular navigation."}

To address this limitation, we introduce UniLACT, a transformer-based VLA model that incorporates geometric structure through depth-aware latent pretraining, enabling downstream policies to inherit stronger spatial priors. To facilitate this process, we propose UniLARN, a unified latent action learning framework based on inverse and forward dynamics objectives that learns a shared embedding space for RGB and depth while explicitly modeling their cross-modal interactions. This formulation produces modality-specific and unified latent action representations that serve as pseudo-labels for the depth-aware pretraining of UniLACT. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the effectiveness of depth-aware unified latent action representations. UniLACT consistently outperforms RGB-based latent action baselines under in-domain and out-of-domain pretraining regimes, as well as on both seen and unseen manipulation tasks."}

An important bottleneck faced by existing differentiable simulation frameworks is contact manifold generation: representing the volume of intersection between two colliding geometries via a discrete set of properly distributed contact points. A major factor contributing to this bottleneck is that the related routines of commonly used robotics simulators were not designed with vectorization and differentiability as a primary concern, and thus rely on logic and control flow that hinder these goals. We instead propose a framework designed from the ground up with these goals in mind, by trying to strike a middle ground between: i) convex primitive based approaches used by common robotics simulators (efficient but not differentiable), and ii) mollified vertex-face and edge-edge unsigned distance-based approaches used by barrier methods (differentiable but inefficient). Concretely, we propose: i) a representative set of smooth analytical signed distance primitives to implement vertex-face collisions, and ii) a novel differentiable edge-edge collision routine that can provide signed distances and signed contact normals. The proposed framework is evaluated via a set of didactic experiments and benchmarked against the collision detection routine of the well-established Mujoco XLA framework, where we observe a significant speedup.

We present PhysMem, a memory framework that enables VLM robot planners to learn physical principles from interaction at test time, without updating model parameters. The system records experiences, generates candidate hypotheses, and verifies them through targeted interaction before promoting validated knowledge to guide future decisions. A central design choice is verification before application: the system tests hypotheses against new observations rather than applying retrieved experience directly, reducing rigid reliance on prior experience when physical conditions change. We evaluate PhysMem on three real-world manipulation tasks and simulation benchmarks across four VLM backbones. On a controlled brick insertion task, principled abstraction achieves 76% success compared to 23% for direct experience retrieval, and real-world experiments show consistent improvement over 30-minute deployment sessions."}

To mitigate injury risks, energy-constraining control approaches are commonly used, often relying on safety thresholds derived from blunt impact data in EN ISO 10218-2:2025. However, this dataset does not extend to edged or pointed collisions. Without scalable, clinically grounded datasets covering diverse contact scenarios, safety validation remains limited. Previous studies have laid the groundwork by assessing surrogate-based velocity and mass limits across various geometries, focusing on perpendicular impacts. This study expands those datasets by including shearing contact scenarios in unconstrained collisions, revealing that collision angle significantly affects injury outcomes. Notably, unconstrained shearing contacts result in fewer injuries than perpendicular ones. By reevaluating all prior porcine surrogate data, we establish energy thresholds across geometries and contact types, forming the first energy-based Injury Protection Database. This enables the development of meaningful energy-limiting controllers that ensure safety across a wide range of realistic collision events."}

We introduce a unified multi-task RL framework that bridges this gap by treating reference motion as a prior for behavioral shaping rather than a deployment-time constraint. A single goal-conditioned policy is trained jointly on two tasks that share the same observation and action spaces, but differ in their initialization schemes, command spaces, and reward structures: (i) a reference-guided imitation task in which reference trajectories define dense imitation rewards but are not provided as policy inputs, and (ii) a goal-conditioned generalization task in which goals are sampled independently of any reference and where rewards reflect only task success. By co-optimizing these objectives within a shared formulation, the policy acquires structured, human-like motor skills from dense reference supervision while learning to adapt these skills to novel goals and initial conditions. This is achieved without adversarial objectives, explicit trajectory tracking, phase variables, or reference-dependent inference. We evaluate the method on a challenging box-based parkour playground that demands diverse athletic behaviors (e.g., jumping and climbing), and show that the learned controller transfers beyond the reference distribution while preserving motion naturalness. Finally, we demonstrate long-horizon behavior generation by composing multiple learned skills, illustrating the flexibility of the learned polices in complex scenarios."}

Our method synthesizes robust grasp configurations informed by human demonstrations and employs an adaptive controller that residually issues joint corrections to prevent in-hand slip while tracking the object trajectory.

Mining these graphs yields a compact set of reusable camera-handling strategy primitives, which provide structured supervision for learning. Online, a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) processes the live laparoscopic view to predict the dominant strategy and discrete image-based motion commands, executed by an IBVS-RCM controller under strict safety constraints; optional speech input enables intuitive human-in-the-loop conditioning.

On the one hand, elevators can cause many conflicts among the agents due to its relatively long traversal time across floors, especially when many agents need to reach a different floor.

Existing acceleration techniques for VLMs, such as token pruning, often result in degraded performance when directly applied to VLA models, as they overlook the relationships between different views and fail to account for the dynamic and task-specific characteristics of robotic operation. To address this, we propose BFA++, a dynamic token pruning framework designed specifically for VLA models. BFA++ introduces a hierarchical pruning strategy guided by two-level importance predictors: an intra-view predictor highlights task-relevant regions within each image to suppress spatial noise, while an inter-view predictor identifies critical camera views throughout different manipulation phases to reduce cross-view redundancy. This design enables efficient token selection while preserving essential visual cues, resulting in improved computational efficiency and higher manipulation success rates. Evaluations on the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that BFA++ consistently outperforms existing methods. BFA++ improves the success rate by about 10% on both the π0 and RDT models, achieving speedup of 1.8X and 1.5X, respectively. Our results highlight that context-sensitive and task-aware token pruning serves as a more effective strategy than full visual processing, enabling faster inference and improved manipulation accuracy in real-world robotic systems."}

To address these issues, we propose IG-RFT, a novel Interaction-Guided Reinforced Fine-Tuning system designed for flow-based VLA models.

Extensive real-world experiments on four challenging long-horizon tasks demonstrate that IG-RFT achieves an average success rate of 85.0%, significantly outperforming SFT (18.8%) and standard Offline RL baselines (40.0%).

This paper addresses this gap by introducing KCFRC, a novel approach for efficient foothold reachability analysis. We first formally define the foothold reachability problem and establish a sufficient condition for foothold reachability. Based on this condition, we develop the KCFRC algorithm, which enables robots to validate foothold reachability in real time. Our experimental results demonstrate that KCFRC achieves remarkable time efficiency, completing foothold reachability checks for a single leg across 900 potential footholds in an average of 2 ms. Furthermore, we show that KCFRC can accelerate trajectory optimization and is particularly beneficial for contact planning in confined spaces, enhancing the adaptability and robustness of legged robots in challenging environments."}

However, previous methods are severely limited by treating each transfer as an isolated endeavor, demanding repeated, costly tuning and wasting prior transfer experience.To move beyond isolated sim-to-real, we build a continual cross-task sim-to-real transfer paradigm centered on knowledge accumulation across iterative transfers, thereby enabling effective and efficient adaptation to novel tasks. Thus, we propose GeCo-SRT, a geometry-aware continual adaptation method. It utilizes domain-invariant and task-invariant knowledge from local geometric features as a transferable foundation to accelerate adaptation during subsequent sim-to-real transfers. This method starts with a geometry-aware mixture-of-experts module, which dynamically activates experts to specialize in distinct geometric knowledge to bridge observation sim-to-real gap. Further, the geometry-expert-guided prioritized experience replay module preferentially samples from underutilized experts, refreshing specialized knowledge to combat forgetting and maintain robust cross-task performance. Leveraging knowledge accumulated during iterative transfer, GeCo-SRT method not only achieves 52% average performance improvement over the baseline, but also demonstrates significant data efficiency for new task adaptation with only 1/6 data.We hope this work inspires approaches for efficient, low-cost cross-task sim-to-real transfer."}

Existing methods, employ a variety of open-loop and closed-loop approaches but lack an end-to-end solution that can grasp several objects while taking into account the downstream task's constraints. Our proposed approach employs reinforcement learning to enhance task-oriented grasping, prioritizing the post-grasp intention of the agent. We extract human grasp preferences from the ContactPose dataset, and train a hand synergy model based on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to imitate the participant's grasping actions. Based on this data, we train an agent able to grasp multiple objects while taking into account distinct post-grasp intentions that are task-specific. By combining data-driven insights from human grasping behavior with learning by exploration provided by reinforcement learning, we can develop humanoid robots capable of context-aware manipulation actions, facilitating collaboration in human-centered environments."}

The key challenge is twofold: (i) predict multiple plausible ego intentions according to context and (ii) for each intention, predict the joint responses of surrounding agents, enabling effective what-if decision-making. However, existing methods often fall short, typically treating these interdependent problems in isolation. We propose ParkDiffusion++, which jointly learns a multi-modal ego intention predictor and an ego-conditioned multi-agent joint trajectory predictor for automated parking. Our approach makes several key contributions. First, we introduce an ego intention tokenizer that predicts a small set of discrete endpoint intentions from agent histories and vectorized map polylines. Second, we perform ego-intention-conditioned joint prediction, yielding socially consistent predictions of the surrounding agents for each possible ego intention. Third, we employ a lightweight safety-guided denoiser with different constraints to refine joint scenes during training, thus improving accuracy and safety. Fourth, we propose counterfactual knowledge distillation, where an EMA teacher refined by a frozen safety-guided denoiser provides pseudo-targets that capture how agents react to alternative ego intentions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ParkDiffusion++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Importantly, qualitative what-if visualizations show that other agents react appropriately to different ego intentions."}

However, thermal Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) remains difficult due to unreliable feature extraction, unstable motion tracking, and inconsistent global pose and map construction, particularly in dynamic large-scale outdoor environments. To address these challenges, we propose LST-SLAM, a novel large-scale stereo thermal SLAM system that achieves robust performance in complex, dynamic scenes. Our approach combines self-supervised thermal feature learning, stereo dual-level motion tracking, and geometric pose optimization. We also introduce a semantic-geometric hybrid constraint that suppresses potentially dynamic features lacking strong inter-frame geometric consistency. Furthermore, we develop an online incremental bag-of-words model for loop closure detection, coupled with global pose optimization to mitigate accumulated drift. Extensive experiments on kilometer-scale dynamic thermal datasets show that LST-SLAM significantly outperforms recent representative SLAM systems, including AirSLAM and DROID-SLAM, in both robustness and accuracy."}

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with vision-based systems support these missions through prior terrain investigation or real-time assistance during the mission itself. Vision-based UAV frameworks aid human search tasks by detecting and recognizing specific individuals, then tracking and following them while maintaining a safe distance. A key safety requirement for UAV following is the accurate estimation of the distance between camera and target object under real-world conditions, achieved by fusing multiple image modalities. UAVs with deep learning-based vision systems offer a new approach to the planning and execution of SAR operations. As part of the system for automatic people detection and face recognition using deep learning, in this paper we present the fusion of depth camera measurements and monocular camera-to-body distance estimation for robust tracking and following. Deep learning-based filtering of depth camera data and estimation of camera-to-body distance from a monocular camera are achieved with YOLO-pose, enabling real-time fusion of depth information using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm. The proposed subsystem, designed for use in drones, estimates and measures the distance between the depth camera and the human body keypoints, to maintain the safe distance between the drone and the human target. Our system provides an accurate estimated distance, which has been validated against motion capture ground truth data. The system has been tested in real time indoors, where it reduces the average errors, root mean square error (RMSE) and standard deviations of distance estimation up to 15,3\\% in three tested scenarios."}

The robot integrates electro-mechanical property measurement, programmable voltage input, and multi-channel testing capacity. Using it, we scanned the lifetime of Elastosil-based linear actuators across parameters including input voltage magnitude, frequency, electrode material concentration, and electrical connection filler. The optimal parameter combinations improved operational lifetime under boundary operating conditions by up to 100% and were subsequently scaled up to achieve higher force and displacement output. The final product demonstrated resilience on a modular, scalable quadruped walking robot with payload carrying capacity (>100% of its untethered body weight, and >700% of combined actuator weight). This work is the first to introduce a self-driving lab approach into robotic actuator design."}

In this work, we explore a way to impart both spatial and temporal memory to a VLA by incorporating a language scratchpad. The scratchpad makes it possible to memorize task-specific information, such as object positions, and it allows the model to keep track of a plan and progress towards subgoals within that plan. We evaluate this approach on a split of memory-dependent tasks from the ClevrSkills environment, on MemoryBench, as well as on a challenging real-world pick-and-place task. We show that incorporating a language scratchpad significantly improves generalization on these tasks for both non-recurrent and recurrent models."}

The design features a tunable lattice layer that simultaneously modulates mechanical compliance and sensing performance. By adjusting lattice geometry, both stiffness and sensor response can be tailored to handle objects with varying mechanical properties. Experiments demonstrate that by easily adjusting one parameter, the lattice density, from 7 % to 20 %, it is possible to significantly alter the sensitivity and operational force range (about -23x and 9x, respectively). This approach establishes a blueprint for creating adaptive, sensorized surfaces where mechanical and sensory properties are co-optimized, enabling passive, yet programmable, delicate manipulation."}

In EDID, robots are allowed to exchange information only upon meeting. Crucially, EDID assumes that the robots are not allowed to schedule their meetings. As such, the robots have no means to anticipate when, where, and who they will meet. As a step towards the design of storage and routing algorithms for EDID, in this paper we propose a model of information diffusion that captures the essential dynamics of EDID. The model is derived from first principles and is composed of two levels: a micro model, based on a generalization of the concept of `mean free path'; and a macro model, which captures the global dynamics of information diffusion. We validate the model through extensive robot simulations, in which we consider swarm size, communication range, environment size, and different random motion regimes. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the implications of this model on the algorithms that best support information diffusion according to the parameters of interest."}

Recent works introduce textual chain-of-thought or visual subgoal prediction within VLA models to reason, but still fail to offer a unified human-like reasoning framework for joint textual reasoning, visual foresight, and action prediction. To this end, we propose HALO, a unified VLA model that enables embodied multimodal chain-of-thought (EM-CoT) reasoning through a sequential process of textual task reasoning, visual subgoal prediction for fine-grained guidance, and EM-CoT-augmented action prediction. We instantiate HALO with a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture that decouples semantic reasoning, visual foresight, and action prediction into specialized experts while allowing seamless cross-expert collaboration. To enable HALO learning at scale, we introduce an automated pipeline to synthesize EM-CoT training data along with a carefully crafted training recipe. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) HALO achieves superior performance in both simulated and real-world environments, surpassing baseline policy pi_0 by 34.1% on RoboTwin benchmark; (2) all proposed components of the training recipe and EM-CoT design help improve task success rate; and (3) HALO exhibits strong generalization capabilities under aggressive unseen environmental randomization with our proposed EM-CoT reasoning."}

While effective in restricted settings, these systems lack generalization capabilities, limiting the scalability of embodied AI and general-purpose robots. Recent data-driven Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches aim to learn policies from large-scale simulation and real-world data. However, the continuous action space of the physical world significantly exceeds the representational capacity of linguistic tokens, making it unclear if scaling data alone can yield general robotic intelligence. To address this gap, we propose ActionReasoning, an LLM-driven framework that performs explicit action reasoning to produce physics-consistent, prior-guided decisions for robotic manipulation. ActionReasoning leverages the physical priors and real-world knowledge already encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) and structures them within a multi-agent architecture. We instantiate this framework on a tractable case study of brick stacking, where the environment states are assumed to be already accurately measured. The environmental states are then serialized and passed to a multi-agent LLM framework that generates physics-aware action plans. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent LLM framework enables stable brick placement while shifting effort from low-level domain-specific coding to high-level tool invocation and prompting, highlighting its potential for broader generalization. This work introduces a promising approach to bridging perception and execution in robotic manipulation by integrating physical reasoning with LLMs."}

In many applications, Euclidean shortest paths form the underpinning of the navigation system. For such applications, any-angle planning methods, which find optimal paths by connecting corners of obstacles with straight-line segments, provide a simple and efficient solution. In this paper, we present a method that has the optimality and completeness properties of any-angle planners while overcoming computational tractability issues common to search-based methods by exploiting multi-resolution representations.

Squint achieves this via parallel simulation, a distributional critic, resolution squinting, layer normalization, a tuned update-to-data ratio, and an optimized implementation.
